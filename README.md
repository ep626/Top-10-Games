This web app: **The web app I created shows the top 10 games I like to play! Once you click the button, it will send you to the video game's website or where to purchase the game.**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

Besides the web app's responsive UI, I added a gradient background to provide a better experience for users. I also added a genre description for users to see what type of videogame it is, as well as adding some animation to the shadows.

## Challenges

Starting this project from scratch, I wanted to create something responsive and visually pleasing. Formatting all the images to fit correctly and creating the shadow transitions was very interesting. Besides that, I enjoyed developing this porject on my own, and look forward to creating more reactive things in the future.
